# Machine Learning Projects Showcase

Welcome to my GitHub repository where I present three distinct machine learning projects. These projects cover house price prediction, wine quality evaluation, and iris flower species classification. The datasets for these projects were sourced from Kaggle.

## Project 1: House Price Estimation

**Overview:**
In this project, I've developed a machine learning model to predict house prices using linear regression. The Jupyter notebook contains the following key components:
- Data Preprocessing
- Data Visualization
- Conversion of Categorical Features to Numeric
- Min-Max Scaling of Numeric Features
- Data Splitting (Train-Test)
- Model Building (Linear Regression)
- Evaluation Metrics Calculation
- Making Predictions on New Data

The code for this project is available in the House Price Prediction.ipynb file.

## Project 2: Wine Quality Assessment

**Overview:**
This project is dedicated to predicting the quality of wine using both linear regression and random forest models. The Jupyter notebook includes the following stages:
- Data Preprocessing
- Data Visualization
- Data Oversampling for Quality Balance
- Data Splitting (Train-Test)
- Model Creation (Linear Regression and Random Forest)
- Evaluation Metrics Computation for Both Models
- Utilizing the Random Forest Model for Predictions on New Data

You can find the code for this project in the Wine Quality.ipynb file.

## Project 3: Iris Flower Species Classification

**Overview:**
In this project, I've constructed a model to classify different species of iris flowers based on the length of their petals and sepals using logistic regression. The Jupyter notebook involves the following steps:
- Data Preprocessing
- Data Visualization
- Encoding Categorical Data (Species Column)
- Data Splitting (Train-Test)
- Model Development (Logistic Regression)
- Evaluation Metrics Calculation
- Making Predictions on New Data

The code for this project can be accessed in the Iris Flower Classification.ipynb file.

## Datasets

The datasets for these projects were sourced from Kaggle, a renowned platform for data science and machine learning enthusiasts. The specific datasets used in these projects are available on Kaggle.
